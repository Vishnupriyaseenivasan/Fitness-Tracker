Usage
Login Page
The Login page allows users to input their credentials and access the Dashboard. Once logged in, users can track their fitness data such as the number of workouts completed, calories burned, and more.

Dashboard
The Dashboard component displays fitness progress and other stats. It uses Recharts to present workout data in the form of interactive charts like LineChart and BarChart.

Navigation
Navigation between the Login page and Dashboard is handled by React Router. You can access the Login page by navigating to the root URL (/), and the Dashboard by navigating to /dashboard.

Libraries Used
1. React Router (for routing)
React Router allows for seamless navigation between pages like the Login and Dashboard without reloading the page.
Installation: npm install react-router-dom
2. Recharts (for data visualization)
Recharts provides interactive charts to visualize fitness data.
Installation: npm install recharts
3. React Icons (for icons)
React Icons provides a collection of scalable vector icons for easy use in the UI.
